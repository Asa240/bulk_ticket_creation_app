# Bulk Ticket Creation App

This ticket sidebar app creates fake tickets in bulk. It is commonly used for staging demo and trial accounts with a sampling of fake support tickets. 

Current Limitation: you must enter a fake Requester name/email. That will become the End User for all of the tickets created. In future updates, mulitple End Users will be automatically applied from a list of fake names/emails.  

Please submit bug reports [here](https://github.com/Asa240/bulk_ticket_creation_app/issues). Pull requests are welcome.
