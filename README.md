# Bulk Ticket Creation App

***UPDATE (Spring'18)*** this app is now on the v2 Zendesk App Framework!

This ticket sidebar app creates fake tickets in bulk. 

Commonly used for... 

<ul>
  <li>staging trial / demo accounts</li>
  <li>training for new Agents</li>
  <li>general testing</li>
</ul>  


<span style="color:red;font-size:20px;"> NOTE: you'll likely want to <strong>disable any Triggers and/or Automations before performing an import</strong>. To prevent bulk notifications/emails to be sent out.</span>

FULL DISCLOSURE: Much of the code for this app was "borrowed" from an existing app. [training-tickets-creator-app](https://github.com/ZendeskES/training-tickets-creator-app). The developer of that app deserves significant credit.
